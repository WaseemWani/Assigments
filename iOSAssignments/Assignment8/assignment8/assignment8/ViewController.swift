/* Question 2
 Frame defines the x,y coordinates and height and witdth of a view with respect to the safe area
while as bound defines the same attributes with respect to the view itself
 strong property: by strong property we mean that an object holding a strong reference to another object has retain count of 1 and as a result it remains alive in memory and is not deallocated.
 weak property: by weak property we mean that an object holding a weak reference to another object has a retain count of 0, as result it is deallocated when not needed.
 
 clipToBounds is a property of views, taking a boolean value, setting it true means that the frame beyond the boundary of a view is clipped to the bounds of the view. if it is set false , it means that if frame extends beyond the bounds of the view, it will not be clipped
 
 maskToBounds:
